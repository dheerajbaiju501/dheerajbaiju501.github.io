We propose a two-stage framework, d1, that employs masked SFT on distilled reasoning traces, followed by a variant of GRPO for dLLMs, called diffu-GRPO, to convert prertrained dLLMs into storng reasoning models. With this, we demonstrate strong reasoning performance against AR models, and superior convergence rate to conventional GRPO!
